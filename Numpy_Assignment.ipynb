    "#Ans.In NumPy, vectorization involves performing operations on entire arrays at once, instead of iterating through individual elements. Broadcasting is\n",
    "#   a mechanism that enables NumPy to handle operations on arrays with different shapes by conceptually \"stretching\" the smaller array to match the\n",
    "#   larger one. Both significantly enhance efficiency in array operations. \n",
    "#Vectorization:\n",
    "#Definition:\n",
    "#Vectorization replaces loops with vectorized operations, enabling NumPy to perform operations on all elements of an array simultaneously. \n",
    "#Benefits:\n",
    "#Speed: Vectorized operations are significantly faster than explicit Python loops due to C implementation and efficient memory usage. \n",
    "#Conciseness: Code becomes more readable and compact. \n",
    "#Memory Efficiency: NumPy arrays are designed for efficient storage and manipulation, further enhancing performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "#Broadcasting:\n",
    "#Definition:\n",
    "#Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays with different shapes by implicitly expanding the smaller array to match the larger one. \n",
    "#Benefits:\n",
    "#Efficiency: Broadcasting avoids explicit reshaping or looping, leading to faster execution. \n",
    "#Flexibility: It enables operations on arrays with varying shapes without the need for manual reshaping. \n",
    "#Code Readability: It simplifies operations, making code more concise and understandable. "
